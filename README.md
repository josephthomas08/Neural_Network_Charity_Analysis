## Deliverable 1.0: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model


### The following preprocessing steps have been performed:
#### D 1.1 The EIN and NAME columns have been dropped 
#### D 1.2 The columns with more than 10 unique values have been grouped together 
#### D 1.3 TThe categorical variables have been encoded using one-hot encoding 
#### D 1.4 The preprocessed data is split into features and target arrays 
#### D 1.5 The preprocessed data is split into training and testing datasets 
#### D 1.6 The numerical values have been standardized using the StandardScaler() module 

## Deliverable 2.0 : Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model


### The neural network model using Tensorflow Keras contains working code that performs the following steps:
#### D2.1 The number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and activation function are defined
#### D2.1 An output layer with an activation function is created 
#### D2.1 There is an output for the structure of the model 
#### D2.1 There is an output of the modelâ€™s loss and accuracy 
#### D2.1 The model's weights are saved every 5 epochs 
#### D2.1 The results are saved to an HDF5 file 


## Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model

### The model is optimized, and the predictive accuracy is increased to over 75%, or there is working code that makes three attempts to increase model performance using the following steps:
#### D3.1 Noisy variables are removed from features 
#### D3.1 Additional neurons are added to hidden layers 
#### D3.1 Additional hidden layers are added
#### D3.1 The activation function of hidden layers or output layers is changed for optimization
#### D3.1 The model's weights are saved every 5 epochs 
#### D3.1 The results are saved to an HDF5 file
